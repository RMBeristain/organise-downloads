# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this project!

Please note that this is an early-stage project with a very narrow focus; features not related to the core functionality
will be rejected.

To keep things simple for such a small project there isn't a "code of conduct" except: be polite and helpful. Requests
that do not follow this simple rule will be rejected.

And lastly, I am beyond rubbish at keeping on top of my email and I'm busy at work, please don't be offended if I take
a while to reply.

## How to Contribute

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3.  Ensure all functions have a corresponding docstring and all non-iteration variables have descriptive names (no 'c' or 't' except in tests!).
4.  Ensure you have added tests for your changes.
5.  Run the tests locally to ensure everything passes:
    ```bash
    go test -v -cover ./...
    ```
6.  Submit a Pull Request.
7.  Enjoy your good karma!

## Reporting Issues
